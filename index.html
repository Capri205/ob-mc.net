			<p>We have been slowly winding down our setup from a peak of 23 Minecraft servers and some CS:GO, Garry's Mod and Rust servers.
			   We currently operate just the Minecraft build server and our popular 'PlayerServers' from the lobby. PlayerServers is where
			   you can run your very own Minecraft server within our BungeeCord network, complete with a selection of plugins you can install.
			   If you have a particular plugin you want installed or server configuration, then pop a message on our discord and we can help.</p>

				<li class="first">
					<p class="date">Apr 2025</p>
					<p id="smalltext">Built a new Debian 12 minecraft server to replace the current FreeBSD 14 one. Based purely on Velocity and Paper, so we will also need to begin rewriting our plugins for Paper only, starting with a new Velocity based OBMetaProducer for the monitoring dashboard. Gradually moving the lobby and build server over. Started updating plugins to 1.21.5

					<p class="date">Aug 2024</p>
					<p id="smalltext">New features to OBWEReplacer to support torches and entity-to-block and block-to-entity, as well as specifying item for item frames. This enables us to easily update various torches on the airport (lots of them!) to glow item frames, which look way better.

					<p id="smalltext">Build ob-ai from some spare parts! Core i5 4670K/8GB/Dual GTX 960 4GB. Uses ubuntu 24.04 with ollama and stable diffusion. A bit slow and doesn't support large workloads due to the 4GB GPU's, but it functions well enough and it's integrated into my IDE's for coding.

					<p id="smalltext">Added a new feature to LobbyProtect where you can contain mobs in a certain area. You set the home location and a radius and if they wander outside of the radius they will be redirected back to the home. Another new feature for PlayerServers - single biome worlds!

					<p class="date">Jan 2024</p>
					<p id="smalltext">So our PlayerServers feature allows you to load plugins into your server, howver some plugins like terrain generators and custom trees need to be loaded before the server starts. I've added a new 'AddOn' feature to the PlayerServers create server GUI where such plugins can be found and selected. First up is the great Lomax Custom Trees plugin! Give it a try!! Also for that plugin I modified it so you can actually break the player-head apples on the trees to get various apples!

This is amazing as we have thousands of vehicles on the build server that have headlights and tail lights - and now these can glow in the dark!! It's amazing! Except there are thousands of cars! So I made a plugin that will take a world-edit selection and replace them, since WE won't :-)
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class="date">Sep 2023</p>
					<p id="smalltext">Quiet few months on the server as I was playing Ark Evolved! Fun game to play over summer with the kiddiwink. Back to work now though! Reinstated the /seen command to see when a player was last on the server, and also moved to a plugin for loading the build server resource pack on player join.
